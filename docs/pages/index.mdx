Now that you have your data in Embedbase, you can ask ask questions to ChatGPT
about your data:

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy {3}
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai'
const question = 'im looking for a nice pant that is comfortable and i can both use for work and for climbing'
const context = await embedbase.dataset(datasetId).createContext(question)
const prompt = 
    `Based on the following context:\n${context}\nAnswer the user's question: ${question}`
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
})
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
})
console.log(completion.data.choices[0].message?.content)
```
```

and their unique bohemian style can elevate your wardrobe for work.
However, please note that they may not be the most suitable for climbing.

context = embedbase.dataset(dataset_id).create_context(question)
prompt = f'Based on the following context:\n{context}\nAnswer the user\'s question: {question}'

openai.api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
