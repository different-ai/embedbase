Today we're going to learn how to build a custom ChatGPT that can answer questions
about your recruiting tracker database that you store in Notion.

ChatGPT is a game-changer, but it doesn't have any knowledge about your company, your product, or your data. Embedbase makes it easy for you to connect your data to ChatGPT.

## Overview

We're going to cover a few things here, but the big picture is that:{' '}

1. We'll need to send our Notion database to Embedbase every time it changes
2. We'll use Zapier to listen to new Notion database items and send them to Embedbase
3. We'll use Embedbase dashboard to ask questions about our recruiting tracker database

## Diving into the implementation

As a reminder, we will create a **custom ChatGPT** that can answer questions about your recruiting tracker database that you store in Notion.

### Creating a Notion database

If you don't already have a Notion database, let's create one. Head to your Notion workspace.

<Image src="/zapier-notion-click-templates.png" width={800} height={500} />

Then click on "Templates" and search for "Recruiting".

<Image src="/zapier-notion-search-recruiting.png" width={800} height={500} />


### Creating a Zapier Zap

Alright, now that we have a Notion database, let's create a Zapier Zap that will send new items to Embedbase.

If you don't already have a Zapier account, you can create one for free [here](https://zapier.com/sign-up/).

Once you have your account, open this [link](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/182530/927341e3ac2eca4b5602dcf23f0df074/) to get
access to the Embedbase Zapier app.

Then, go to the [Zapier dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard) and click on "Create Zap".

#### Notion Trigger

Let's find the Notion event that will trigger our Zap. Search for "Notion".

<Image src="/zapier-search-notion.png" width={800} height={500} />

Now select the "New Database Item" trigger.

<Image src="/zapier-select-new-database-item.png" width={800} height={500} />

You will need to connect your account to Zapier. Click on "Connect an Account".
You need to give access to Zapier to the pages you want to use that contain the database.

<Image src="/zapier-connect-account.png" width={800} height={500} />

Now you should be able to select your database from the dropdown in the next step:

<Image src="/zapier-select-database.png" width={800} height={500} />

You should get some success message like this:

<Image src="/zapier-success.png" width={800} height={500} />

Awesome! You just created a Zap which triggers when a new Notion database item is created.

#### Embedbase Action

Now let's do something with this event data, like sending it to Embedbase,
search for "Embedbase":

<Image src="/zapier-search-embedbase.png" width={800} height={500} />

Choose the "Add Document" action.

<Image src="/zapier-select-add-document.png" width={800} height={500} />

You need to connect your Embedbase account by adding your Embedbase API key, you can find it in the [Embedbase dashboard](https://app.embedbase.xyz/dashboard).

<Image src="/zapier-add-api-key.png" width={800} height={500} />

<Image src="/copy-api-key.png" width={800} height={500} />

The most important step here is to add the right information from this Notion database item to Embedbase. We'll need to add the following:

<Image src="/zapier-add-document.png" width={800} height={500} />

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note that `path` as a metadata key is a best practice in Embedbase as a way to let ChatGPT provide links to what he says, like and URL or a path to a file.
  Here ChatGPT will be able to point you to your Notion pages in his answers.
</Callout>

You can now test your Zap and see if it works.

<Image src="/zapier-notion-publish.png" width={800} height={500} />

#### Importing existing data

Let's import existing data:

<Image src="/zapier-notion-import-existing-data-one.png" width={800} height={500} />
<Image src="/zapier-notion-import-existing-data-two.png" width={800} height={500} />
<Image src="/zapier-notion-import-existing-data-three.png" width={800} height={500} />

Now, head to [Embedbase dashboard](https://app.embedbase.xyz/dashboard) and you should see your documents.

<Image src="/zapier-notion-dashboard-click-dataset.png" width={800} height={500} />
<Image src="/zapier-notion-explorer.png" width={800} height={500} />

#### Try the playground

The final result, head to the playground and select your Notion dataset and ask a question:

<Image src="/zapier-notion-demo.gif" width={800} height={500} />

## Closing thoughts

In summary, we have:

- created a Notion database
- created a Zapier Zap that sends new Notion database items to Embedbase
- asked questions to our recruiting tracker database

Note here that we imported the existing data, but every time you will add a new item to your Notion database, it will be automatically sent to Embedbase.

That's it for today, you just learned how to use Zapier to connect any data source to Embedbase.

## Where to go from here

Now that all your Notion data is in Embedbase, you can also build experiences programmatically with the Embedbase API and SDKs,
