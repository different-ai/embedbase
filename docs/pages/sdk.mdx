**Open-source API & SDK to connect any data to ChatGPT**

Before you start, you need get a an API key at [app.embedbase.xyz](https://app.embedbase.xyz/signup).

*Note: we're working on a fully client-side SDK. In the meantime, you can use the hosted instance of Embedbase.*


## Design philosophy

- Simple
- Open-source
- Composable (integrates well with any AI providers, databases and LLM helpers)

## What is it

These are the official clients for Embedbase. Open-source API & SDK to easily create, store and retrieve embeddings.

## Who is it for

People who want to
* plug their own data into ChatGPT or any other LLM
* build recommendation systems
* build search engines
* build classification engines
* etc.

## Embedbase Vector
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to work efficiently with high-dimensional vectors, often used for representing data in machine learning applications. Examples of such data include embeddings, which are numerical representations of unstructured data such as text, images, and more. Vector databases enable efficient storage, search, and retrieval of similar items based on their embeddings.

Embedbase Vector makes it easy to use vector dbs. It simplifies the process of working with embeddings and enables users to easily store, index, and search unstructured data. With Embedbase, even those without machine learning expertise can build recommendation engines, search engines, and Q&A engines, offering seamless integration from development to deployment for a wide variety of applications.

## How to use the SDK

### Installation

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```bash copy
npm install embedbase-js
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
```bash copy
pip install embedbase-client
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Initializing

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy
import { createClient } from 'embedbase-js'

// you can find the api key at https://embedbase.xyz
const apiKey = 'your api key'
// this is using the hosted instance
const url = 'https://api.embedbase.xyz'

const embedbase = createClient(url, apiKey)
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
To get started, import the `EmbedbaseClient` class and create a new instance:

```python copy
from embedbase_client import EmbedbaseClient

embedbase_url = "https://api.embedbase.xyz"
embedbase_key = "<get your key here: https://app.embedbase.xyz>"
embedbase = EmbedbaseClient(embedbase_url, embedbase_key)
```

In an **async** context, you can use the `EmbedbaseAsyncClient` class instead.
This class provides the same methods as `EmbedbaseClient`, but they are all asynchronous.
```python copy
from embedbase_client import EmbedbaseAsyncClient
```

Remember to use `await` when calling methods on `EmbedbaseAsyncClient` objects.

Learn more about asynchronous Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Searching datasets

You can search your dataset(s) using natural language queries. Embedbase will return the most similar items to your query, along with their similarity scores.

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>

```ts copy
// fetching data
const data = await embedbase
  .dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews')
  .search('best hot dogs accessories', { limit: 3 })

console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.810843349,
//       "data": "This nice little hot dog toaster is a great addition to our kitchen. It is easy to use and makes a great hot dog. It is also easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hot dogs."
//       "metadata": {
//         "path": "https://amazon.com/hotdogtoaster",
//         "source": "amazon"
//       },
//       "embedding": [0.35332, 0.23423, ...]
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.294602573,
//       "data": "200 years ago, people would never have guessed that humans in the future would communicate by silently tapping on glass",
//       "embedding": [0.76532, 0.23423, ...]
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.192932034,
//       "data": "The average car in space is nicer than the average car on Earth",
//       "embedding": [0.52342, 0.23423, ...]
//   },
// ]
```

You can also filter by metadata:

```ts copy
const data = await embedbase
  .dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews')
  .search('best hot dogs accessories')
  .where('source', '==', "amazon")
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
To search a dataset, call the `search` method on a `Dataset` object:

```python copy
data = embedbase.dataset("your_dataset_name").search("your_query", limit=5).get()
print(data)
# [
#   {
#       "similarity": 0.810843349,
#       "data": "This nice little hot dog toaster is a great addition to our kitchen. It is easy to use and makes a great hot dog. It is also easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hot dogs."
#       "metadata": {
#         "path": "https://amazon.com/hotdogtoaster",
#         "source": "amazon"
#       },
#       "embedding": [0.35332, 0.23423, ...]
#   },
#   {
#       "similarity": 0.294602573,
#       "data": "200 years ago, people would never have guessed that humans in the future would communicate by silently tapping on glass",
#       "embedding": [0.76532, 0.23423, ...]
#   },
#   {
#       "similarity": 0.192932034,
#       "data": "The average car in space is nicer than the average car on Earth",
#       "embedding": [0.52342, 0.23423, ...]
#   },
# ]
```

You can also filter by metadata:

```python copy
embedbase.dataset("your_dataset_name").search("your_query").where("source", "==", "amazon").get()
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Using Bing Search

The point of internet search in embedbase is to combine your private information with latest public information.

Also remember that AIs like ChatGPT have limited knowledge to a certain date, for example try to ask ChatGPT about GPT4 or about Sam Altman talk with the senate (which happened few days ago), it will not know about it.

The recommended workflow is like this:

1. search your question using internet endpoint
2. (optional) add results to embedbase
3. (optional) search embedbase with the question
4. use .generate() to get your question answered

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy
const data = await embedbase
  // for example this is a very recent AI paper that LLM have no knowledge about
  .internetSearch('qlora machine learning paper')
console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//     "title": "Qlora: ...",
//     "description": "We present Qlora, ..."
//     "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07540",
//   },
//   ...
// ]
``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

This is not yet avaiable in the Python SDK, please ping louis030195 on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3X6xZtZ) if you need it
and we will make it happen instantly!

In the meantime check [how to do it using REST](https://docs.embedbase.xyz/interface#using-bing-search)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding Data

You can add data like text to your dataset(s), if you need to add images or other format like audio, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3X6xZtZ) and we will make it happen instantly!

You can also add metadata along the data. It can be useful, for example if you are feeding a LLM like ChatGPT,
a typical best practice is to add the source of the text as metadata.
For example an URL. Then you can ask the AI to add links or footnotes in it's output.

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>

The simplest way to add data to embedbase is to use `chunkAndBatchAdd` which runs ideal parameters by default:

```ts copy
const documents = [
  { data: 'This is a document' },
  { data: 'This is another document' },
  { data: 'This is a third document' },
  { data: 'This is a fourth document' },
  { data: 'This is a fifth document' },
  { data: 'This is a sixth document' },
  { data: 'This is a seventh document' },
  { data: 'This is a eighth document' },
  { data: 'This is a ninth document' },
  { data: 'This is a tenth document', metadata: { path: 'https://google.com/abcd' }}
]
const data = await embedbase.dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews').chunkAndBatchAdd(documents)
console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//     "id": "eiew823",
//     "data": "This is a document",
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   },
//   {
//     "id": "eiew823",
//     "data": "This is another document",
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   },
//   {
//     "id": "eiew823",
//     "data": "This is a third document",
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   },
//   ...
//   {
//     "id": "eiew823",
//     "data": "This is a tenth document",
//     "metadata": {
//       "path": "https://google.com/abcd"
//     },
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   }
// ]
```

You can also use `add`, or `batchAdd`.

  </Tab>
    <Tab>
To add data to a dataset, call the `batch_add` method on a `Dataset` object:

```python copy
data = embedbase.dataset(dataset_id).batch_add([
  {
    "data": "some text",
    # you can also add metadata
    # "metadata": {
    #   "path": "google.com"
    # }
  },
  {
    "data": "some more text",
  },
])
print(data)
# [
#   {
#       "id": "eiew823",
#       "data": "some text",
#       "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
#   },
#   {
#       "id": "eiew823",
#       "data": "some more text",
#       "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
#   },
# ]
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Updating data

To update data, you can either setup a process of inserting in a new dataset fresh data (maybe like git) or
you can use the following method:

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```js copy
const data =
  await embedbase.dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews').update([{
    // you get this id from add/batchAdd/search/list response
    id: 'eiew823',
    data: 'some new text',
  }])
  console.log(data)
// {
//   "id": "eiew823",
//   "data": "some new text",
//   "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
// }
``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

### Splitting and chunking large texts


<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
AI models are often limited in the amount of text they can process at once. Embedbase provides a utility function to split large texts into smaller chunks.
We highly recommend using this function.
To split and chunk large texts, use the `splitText` function:

```js copy
import { splitText } from 'embedbase-js';

const text = 'some very long text...';
// ⚠️ note here that the value of chunkSize depends
// on the used embedder in embedbase.
// With models such as OpenAI's embeddings model, you can
// use a chunkSize of 500. With other models, you may need to
// use a lower chunkSize value.
// (embedbase cloud use openai model at the moment) ⚠️
const chunkSize = 500
// chunk_overlap is the number of tokens that will overlap between chunks
// it is useful to have some overlap to ensure that the context is not
// cut off in the middle of a sentence.
const chunkOverlap = 200
splitText(text, { chunkSize, chunkOverlap }).map(({chunk}) =>
    embedbase.dataset('some-data-set').add(chunk)
)
```

Check [how we send our documentation to Embedbase](https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase-docs/blob/cb082d5b54b1038bee73511d9b9046fbb22d8a6f/scripts/sync.ts) to let you ask it questions through GPT-4.

AI models are often limited in the amount of text they can process at once. Embedbase provides a utility function to split large texts into smaller chunks.
We highly recommend using this function.
To split and chunk large texts, use the `split_text` function from the `split` module:

```python copy
from embedbase_client.split import split_text

text = "your_long_text"
# ⚠️ note here that the value of max_tokens depends
# on the used embedder in embedbase.
# With models such as OpenAI's embeddings model, you can
# use a max_tokens of 500. With other models, you may need to
# use a lower max_tokens value.
# (embedbase cloud use openai model at the moment) ⚠️
max_tokens = 500
# chunk_overlap is the number of tokens that will overlap between chunks
# it is useful to have some overlap to ensure that the context is not
# cut off in the middle of a sentence.
chunk_overlap = 200

chunks = split_text(text, max_tokens, chunk_overlap)

# then ...
documents = []
for c in chunks:
    documents.append({
        "data": c.chunk,
    })
result = embedbase.dataset("my-dataset").batch_add(documents)
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Creating a "context"

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
`createContext` is very similar to `.search` but it returns strings instead of an object. This is useful if you want to easily feed it to GPT.

```js copy
// you can create a context to store data
const data = await embedbase
  .dataset('my-documentation')
  .createContext('my-context')

console.log(data)
[
 "Embedbase API allows to store unstructured data...",
 "Embedbase API has 3 main functions a) provides a plug and play solution to store embeddings b) makes it easy to connect to get the right data into llms c)..",
 "Embedabase API is self-hostable...",
]
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
`create_context` is very similar to `.search` but it returns strings instead of an object. This is useful if you want to easily feed it to GPT.

### Generating text

Under the hood, generating text use OpenAI models. If you are interested in using
other models, such as open-source ones, please contact us.

Remember that this count in your playground usage,
for more information head to the [billing page](https://app.embedbase.xyz/dashboard/pricing).

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy
const data = await embedbase
  .dataset('my-documentation')
  .createContext('my-context')

const question = 'How do I use Embedbase?'
const prompt =
`Based on the following context:\n${data.join('\n')}\nAnswer the user's question: ${question}`

for await (const res of embedbase.generate(prompt)) {
    console.log(res)
    // You, can, use, ...
}
```

You can also send the history, like in [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction):

```ts copy
const history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that teach how to use Embedbase"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How can I connect my data to LLMs using Embedbase?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can npm i embedbase-js, write two lines of code, and..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "how can i do this with my notion pages now using their api?"},
]

// ...
for await (const res of embedbase.generate(prompt, {history})) {
    console.log(res)
    // You, need, to, query, Notion, API, like, so:, ...
}
```

  </Tab>

```python copy
data = embedbase.dataset(dataset_id).create_context("my-context")
question = 'How do I use Embedbase?'
# ⚠️ note here that the prompt depends
# on the used embedder in embedbase.
# See `create_context` doc for details. ⚠️
prompt = (
    "Based on the following context:\n"
    + "\n".join(data)
    + f"\nAnswer the user's question: {question}"
)
for r in embedbase.generate(prompt):
    print(r)
